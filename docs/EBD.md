# EBD: Database Specification Component

Software tool for tracking and managing projects. This application is designed to help users plan, coordinate, and execute tasks that need to be completed to make progress on the project at hand.

## A4: Conceptual Data Model

This artifact presents the Conceptual Data Model using a UML class diagram to document the model. It contains the identification and description of the entities and relationships that are relevant to the database specification.

### 2. Additional Business Rules
- GeneralUser is the conceptual name, in order to separate Admins from the rest of the users.

## A5: Relational Schema, validation and schema refinement

This artifact contains the Relational Schema made by mapping the Conceptual Data Model and represents the relation schema, attributes, domains, primary keys, foreign keys and other integrity rules that will be included in the database.

### 1. Relational Schema
Relation reference| Relation Compact Notation |
--- | --- |
R01 | users(<ins>id</ins>, name **NN**, email **NN** **UK** **CK** valid_email_format, password **NN**)
R02 | admins(<ins>id</ins>, name **NN**, password **NN**)
R03 | company(<ins>id</ins>, name **NN**)
R04 | project(<ins>id</ins>, company_id -> company, name **NN**, details, creation **NN DF** today **CK** creation<=today,delivery **NN CK** delivery>=creation)
R05 | project_member(<ins>users_id</ins> -> users, <ins>project_id</ins> -> project, is_favourite **NN DF** false)
R06 | project_coordinator(<ins>id</ins>, users_id -> users, project_id -> project)
R07 | task(<ins>id</ins>, project_id -> project, creator -> users, name **NN**, details, status **NN**, creation **NN DF** today **CK** creation<=today, delivery **NN CK** delivery>=creation)
R08 | task_assigned(<ins>users_id</ins> -> users, <ins>task_id</ins> -> task)
R09 | comment(<ins>id</ins>, task_id -> task, author -> users, content **NN**, creation **NN DF** today **CK** creation<=today)
R10 | invitation(<ins>project_id</ins> -> project, <ins>users_id</ins> -> users, <ins>project_coordinator_id</ins> -> project_coordinator)
R11 | notification()

Legend:

 - UK = UNIQUE KEY

 - NN = NOT NULL 

 - DF = DEFAULT 

 - CK = CHECK

### 2. Domains
Domain Name| Domain Specification |
--- | --- |
today | TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE
status | ENUM('Completed', 'Ongoing', 'Paused', 'Abandoned')

### 3. Schema validation
Table R01| users |
--- | --- |
**Keys:** {id},{email} 
**Functional Dependencies**
FD0101 | {id} -> {name, email, password}
FD0102 | {email} -> {id, name, password}
**Normal Form** | BCNF

Table R02| admins |
--- | --- |
**Keys:** {id}
**Functional Dependencies**
FD0201 | {id} -> {name, password}
**Normal Form** | BCNF

Table R03| company |
--- | --- |
**Keys:** {id}
**Functional Dependencies**
FD0301 | {id} -> {name}
**Normal Form** | BCNF

Table R04| project |
--- | --- |
**Keys:** {id}
**Functional Dependencies**
FD0401 | {id} -> {company_id, name, details, creation, delivery}
**Normal Form** | BCNF

Table R05| project_member |
--- | --- |
**Keys:** {users_id, project_id}
**Functional Dependencies**
FD0501 | {users_id, project_id} -> {is_favourite}
**Normal Form** | BCNF

Table R06| project_coordinator |
--- | --- |
**Keys:** {id}
**Functional Dependencies**
FD0601 | {id} -> {users_id, project_id}
**Normal Form** | BCNF

Table R07| task |
--- | --- |
**Keys:** {id}
**Functional Dependencies**
FD0701 | {id} -> {project_id, creator, name, details, status, creation, delivery}
**Normal Form** | BCNF

Table R08| task_assigned |
--- | --- |
**Keys:** {users_id, task_id}
**Functional Dependencies** | none
**Normal Form** | BCNF

Table R09| comment |
--- | --- |
**Keys:** {id}
**Functional Dependencies**
FD0901 | {id} -> {task_id, author, content, creation}
**Normal Form** | BCNF

Table R010| invitation |
--- | --- |
**Keys:** {project_id, users_id, project_coordinator_id}
**Functional Dependencies** | none
**Normal Form** | BCNF

Table R011| notification |
--- | --- |
**Keys:** {}
**Functional Dependencies**
FD1101 | 
**Normal Form** | BCNF

Because all relations are in the Boyceâ€“Codd Normal Form (BCNF), the relational schema is also in the BCNF and, therefore, the schema does not need to be further normalized.

## A6: Indexes, triggers, transactions and database population

This artifact contains the physical schema of the database, the identification and characterisation of the indexes, the support of data integrity rules with triggers and the definition of the database user-defined functions.

Furthermore, it also shows the database transactions needed to assure the integrity of the data in the presence of concurrent accesses. For each transaction, the isolation level is explicitly stated and justified.

This artifact also contains the database's workload as well as the complete database creation script, including all SQL necessary to define all integrity constraints, indexes and triggers. Finally, this artifact also includes a separate script with INSERT statements to populate the database.
