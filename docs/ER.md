# ER: Requirements Specification Component

Software tool for tracking and managing projects. This application is designed to help users plan, coordinate, and execute tasks that need to be completed to make progress on the project at hand.

# A1: ProjeTatu

The primary goal of this project is to provide organizations,teams, or individuals with an intuitive web-based project management solution that optimizes project planning, task allocation, and progress tracking.

Our motivation behind the development of this project is to simplify and streamline the whole process of project development, and to empower its users and teams to a more efficient and productive work flow by creating a user-friendly platform.

This project allows users to create and manage projects, break them down into tasks, assign team members to these tasks as well as leave comments on them, and monitor progress. Each projects will also be accomodated with a discussion forum to allow its members a method for quick communication.

Users are categorized into three different groups, admnistrators, authenticated and non-authenticated user. Admnistrators will not be able to create of participate in projects but will serve as the higher manager of the whole system, as it will be able to browse and view projects details and moderate users. Authenticated Users will also be categorized into two groups, Coordinator and Member, with varying permissions within the projects. Coordinator are Users that created a project and have complete access to it, they can add and remove team members as well as assign new coordinators, edit project details and change the project status. Members will be able to manage tasks, assign users to them as well as comment on them and change their status. Authenticated Users can also be in more than one project. Non-authenticated users simply have access to registration and login.

# A2: Actors and User stories

# A3: Information Architecture

This artifact presents an overview of the information architecture about the system to be developed. It has the following goals:

 1. Help identify and describe the user requirements, and raise new ones;
 2. Preview and empirically test the user interface of the product to be developed;
 3. Enable quick and multiple iterations on the design of the user interface.

This artifact includes two elements:

 1. A sitemap, defining how the information is organized in pages;
 2. A set of wireframes, defining the functionality and the content for each page.

## 1. Sitemap

The following Sitemap depicts the different pages intended in our application and the relationships in between them. Our system is organized in 5 main groups: 
1. The **Unauthenticated User Pages** displays the information about the page and offers the possibility of entering the system as an authenticated user. 
2. The **Public Pages** contain the general, public knowledge on the use of the application. 
3. The **Authenticated User Pages** that allows an user to manage their profile. 
4. The **Authenticated Admin Pages** that restrics the administrator to manage the usage of the app itself.
5. The **Project Pages** themselves which include the main interactions regarding all the projects available (which are here in a stack) and all the tasks assigned to them.
