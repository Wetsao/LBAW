# A3: Information Architecture

This artifact presents an overview of the information architecture about the system to be developed. It has the following goals:

 1. Help identify and describe the user requirements, and raise new ones;
 2. Preview and empirically test the user interface of the product to be developed;
 3. Enable quick and multiple iterations on the design of the user interface.

This artifact includes two elements:

 1. A sitemap, defining how the information is organized in pages;
 2. A set of wireframes, defining the functionality and the content for each page.

# 1. Sitemap

The following Sitemap depicts the different pages intended in our application and the relationships in between them. Our system is organized in 5 main groups: 
1. The **Unauthenticated User Pages** displays the information about the page and offers the possibility of entering the system as an authenticated user. 
2. The **Public Pages** contain the general, public knowledge on the use of the application. 
3. The **Authenticated User Pages** that allows an user to manage their profile. 
4. The **Authenticated Admin Pages** that restrics the administrator to manage the usage of the app itself.
5. The **Project Pages** themselves which include the main interactions regarding all the projects available (which are here in a stack) and all the tasks assigned to them.
